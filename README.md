This is just a political joke related to the http://bash.org.pl/4861074/

## background
There is (was) a Polish right-wing political party called [KORWiN](http://www.partiakorwin.pl) (after the surname of its founder).

Its founder is known for a very radical thinking and impolite answers to journalists (and others).

The idea brought on Polish Bash board was to prepare a snippet/library showing up this radical approach by changing all 'left' floats to 'right'.

## why
I found it funny and just wanted the idea to become reality :)
